# Simple ToDo App in ReactJS with TypeScript

This is a simple todo app in ReactJS with TypeScript. This is for beginners to get familiar with different topics of typescript and let them understand how to use typescript in reactjs. I've created a detailed tutorial explaining all these things on YouTube.

This project is created with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
